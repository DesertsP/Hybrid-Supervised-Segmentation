#  Label-Efficient Hybrid-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation
This is the official implementaion of paper " Label-Efficient Hybrid-Supervised Learning for Medical Image Segmentation".

This repository contains PyTorch training and evaluation code for Pascal VOC 2012 and COCO dataset.
This code is messy and unsorted now, we will clean it up in the future.

```bash
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 train_xx.py --config configs/xx.yaml
```
